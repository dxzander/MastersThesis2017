# MastersThesis2017
Automatic depression classifier that combines linguistic features with behavioral features (time of publication), based on reddit dataset for CLEF's ERISK 2017.
The code here presented was developed under a rapid development environment, with tens or even hundreds of experiments per week for months, until ariving at the current state.
The main purpose of this repository is to showcase my work. The code here has had the paths modified in an attempt to make it run under any environment (i.e. not in the original thesis environment), but it remains untested. Run at discression.
